# Google Ads Integration Project

This project demonstrates the integration of Google Ads (Banner, Interstitial, Video Ads) for app monetization.

## Features

- **Interstitial Ads**: Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of their host app. They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game.
- **Banner Ads**: Banner ads are rectangular ads that occupy a portion of an app's layout. They stay on screen while users are interacting with the app, either anchored at the top or bottom of the screen or inline with content as the user scrolls.
- **Rewarded Ads**: Rewarded ads allow you to reward users with in-app items for interacting with video ads, playable ads, and surveys.

## Tools Used

- **Android Studio**: IDE for building and testing the Android app.
- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language used for app development.
- **XML**: Used for UI design in Android layout files.
- **Google Admod**: Used for Ads handling.
